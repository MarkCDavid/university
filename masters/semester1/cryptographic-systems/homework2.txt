=== Task 3:
As I am using Python to complete the homework, I've expanded the task to find collisions as follows:
For weak collision, find collision using last 32 bits (2 hexadecimal symbols);
For strong collision, find collision using last 64 bits (4 hexadecimal symbols).

SHA2 (256) of A is: ba2d1465b07b233416a3d44aae0772784573c4719f15b8382313b30d7c60aa87
SHA3 (256) of A is: e21d94126663f1219756899754b807f59940f0b14248a6e42b500b3a3f5b1c34
