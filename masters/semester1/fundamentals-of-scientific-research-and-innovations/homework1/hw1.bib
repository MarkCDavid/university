abstract = {System security assurance provides the confidence that security features, practices, procedures, and architecture of software systems mediate and enforce the security policy and are resilient against security failure and attacks. Alongside the significant benefits of security assurance, the evolution of new information and communication technology (ICT) introduces new challenges regarding information protection. Security assurance methods based on the traditional tools, techniques, and procedures may fail to account new challenges due to poor requirement specifications, static nature, and poor development processes. The common criteria (CC) commonly used for security evaluation and certification process also comes with many limitations and challenges. In this paper, extensive efforts have been made to study the state-of-the-art, limitations and future research directions for security assurance of the ICT and cyber–physical systems (CPS) in a wide range of domains. We conducted a systematic review of requirements, processes, and activities involved in system security assurance including security requirements, security metrics, system and environments and assurance methods. We highlighted the challenges and gaps that have been identified by the existing literature related to system security assurance and corresponding solutions. Finally, we discussed the limitations of the present methods and future research directions.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a content-oriented no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment (VQA) method for computer graphics (CG) animation videos. First, we extract features in terms of spatiotemporal information and its visual perception from the videos as inputs of our proposed artificial neural network-based VQA model. Second, to facilitate the video quality evaluation, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the VQA model to generate weight factors for the input features adaptively according to the different types of CG content in videos. Third, we build a subjective CG video quality database for validation of VQA metrics. Experiments demonstrated that our method achieved superior performance in terms of evaluating the quality of CG animation videos. Both the code and proposed database are publicly available at https://github.com/WeizhiXian/CGVQA. The corresponding newly established database is available at https:// pan.baidu.com/s/1_P2ZNrLzJwZfG6xa6tKnDQ (password: cgvq).}

abstract = {Given that there are an increasing number of information security breaches, organizations are being driven to adopt best practice for coping with attacks. Information security standards are designed to embody best practice and the legitimacy of these standards is a core issue for standardizing organizations. This study uncovers how structures at play in de jure standard development affect the input and throughput legitimacy of standards. We participated as members responsible for standards on information security and our analysis revealed two structures: consensus and warfare. A major implication of the combination of these structures is that legitimacy claims based on appeals to best practice are futile because it is difficult to know which the best practice is.}
